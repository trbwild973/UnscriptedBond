        <h2 class="h2class">
            Ok little child, so you are here because someone talked behind your back? Well child, honestly I’d say just leave them, you’ve gone through enough with your past, you have had enough with everything, from g7, g9. Somehow you always get something against you. But little child, you’ve gone through a lot in the past, just ignore them. Remember, everything that happens, always happens for a reason, if that person talked behind your back, that is god showing you that that person is not for you, and might mis-lead you into something bad. :0 while typing this I shocked myself using the “-“ for the mis-lead. But anyways see what I do for you, using perfect grammar, if only I could do smth like this for English as well lmao. Anyways little child, for the person that talked behind your back, just leave them, you are way better than anyone that talks behind your back, it doesn’t matter what happens, they won’t make it far by doing such, let them waste their time, don’t waste yours thinking about it. What happened happened. I know it hurts, you might have been close, or looked at that person as a good person, or close friend, but yk what to do, just leave him/her. Not worth it child. Useless people like that shouldn’t be worth the time. Just move on, you have so many more friends, if you don’t in Indo, you have me, Sans, Meghana, Celine, all of us back here in Rwanda for you. You will always have us.
        </h2>
        <br>
<h2 class="h2class">For a quick solution to get them to stop talking behind your back, just tell them I’m ur man, everyone knows me across all borders, they’ll instantly know not to mess with you, if they continue, tell me, I’ll fly over for a day and fight all of them. Maybe if I can’t then like kinda just ignore them ig, until I come ofc dw, I will come eventually tho so yea. But yea either way I will fight them so warn them ahead of time. Now child, don’t think about that person now, leave him/her, not worth the time, they are useless, what happened happened for a reason, just be happy it happened before you got too close, or be happy it happened before you did something bad with him/her. Take care child, ik sometimes you will be here without telling me, maybe not like that, but sometimes I know you might not always tell me what happens, so its fine child, but you can trust me ok, just go to ig, and yap there, I will always be happy to listen to you yap child. </h2><br> <h2 class="h2class">Anyways, either way, just leave that person ok child, you have other friends child, you will always have me child, you can always count on me child, you can tell me when something happens, whatever happens with your social life in Indonesia, you will always have me ok. Now just yap on ig.</h2>
