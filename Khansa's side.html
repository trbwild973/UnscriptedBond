        <p>This is just a story from a POV of an Indonesian girl who travelled 5,801 miles to find out she met someone she never thought she would meet. One day on the day when the school had a grade 9 parents, students, and teachers meeting, there in the dining hall where we first met face to face for the first time. I was sitting peacefully and eating my lunch and there he was, Kavya Sharma, his name. I never expected us to meet and be in almost every class that I have. The first impression that I made was ‚ÄúThis guy is friendly but annoying at the same time‚Äù, mhmm yeah annoying at the same time. Well, I remember when we were waiting for the meeting to start, he was constantly tapping my shoulder and every time I turned to look at him he just said ‚ÄúHow can I help you‚Äù, he still does that now but differently every time. If you‚Äôre wondering how do we get close? We got close from that one interaction we had after school when Celine asked Kavya to drop me off at the Primary building since Celine couldn‚Äôt drop me off. I still remember the feeling, it was awkward since I‚Äôm an introvert and didn‚Äôt know how to start a conversation until Kavya said hi to Mrs. Phoebe. I wasn‚Äôt expecting Mrs. Phoebe to ask ‚ÄúAre you guys siblings?‚Äù Yes, I know right she thought we were siblings, I don‚Äôt think we even look like siblings. Well but from one moment that walk didn‚Äôt become awkward again, rather it was more lively. I still remember clearly, that I asked Kavya for his Instagram because why not right? I need to make friends. I was in my room laying down in my bed trying to find his Instagram and finally found it after many attempts putting his username, I finally found it. At that time he followed me back and chatted with me, I still remember he was making noodles for his little sister Yaashi. From that interaction we had that day we just became close.
        </p>
         <br>
         <p> Days by days pass our bond became stronger each day. I can‚Äôt imagine if didn‚Äôt know Kavya now, he‚Äôs the best friend that I could ever ask in the whole world. I can‚Äôt exactly explain how we became close after that one interaction we had, but we trust each other that‚Äôs what makes us very close. We always have each other back, no matter what happens. Of course, we always have an argument or sometimes we fight over the stupidest things at each other, but we understand each other situation and at the end of the day we always get back again. Let me explain how Kavya is in my POV, well he‚Äôs just an Indian boy that randomly spawned in my life. He‚Äôs annoying most of the time and childish at one time of the day. Even though he‚Äôs annoying and likes to just tickle me and make fun of me 24/7, he‚Äôs a caring guy who likes to hear me yap every day. He‚Äôs always there for me whenever I need him, he doesn‚Äôt like to see me suffer alone when I have a problem. Kavya knows whenever I‚Äôm thinking about something that just bugs my mind, he gets soft when I feel sad just to assure me that I‚Äôm fine. He‚Äôs an animal lover and loves cars with passion. Every time he sees a beautiful car, he always tells me to buy the car for him in the future. Ok even though he says that, he owes me many things, from driving his Ferrari, my jellycat plushies, magnum ice cream, and many more to be honest. Yes, this child is goofy, always telling me to get the car and all, and even though he claims himself as a big brother I‚Äôm still older and I see him as a child. He‚Äôs always the first one to miss me, even though I just leave him for a few hours he just misses me instantly. He also likes my hugs, ok but not gonna lie I like his hugs too because I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs just different. Anyway, Kavya is a caring guy who cares too much and worries about everything, he always says he promises that he will show me the better side of the world and treat me right. There are a lot of things about him but I can‚Äôt explain it with thousand or millions words, but I‚Äôm grateful that we can meet and be this close. After almost 1 year of friendship and still counting, I hope we are still friends even if we are worlds apart, and distance doesn‚Äôt make us strangers but rather makes our bond stronger. Thank you for being my closest friend Kavya Sharma, you don‚Äôt know how much you mean to me. ü§ç
