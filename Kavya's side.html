        <p class="pclass"> From strangers to closest friends???? It’s possible, it’s annoying sometimes, its interesting, but for the most part, when it's real, it's the best feeling ever. Who would’ve guessed that we would go from barely knowing each other's names to becoming closest friends? Well not me that's for sure. It was the beginning of the school year and I realized that in almost every class I was in, there was always one name repeating over and over again, Khansa Salvia. Innocent in looks, but looks can be deceiving. Though I knew her name, and knew we were in quite literally almost every single class together, we never really met, and I was never really bothered to introduce myself, however it all changed one day when a mutual friend of ours asked me to drop her off. Well yes of course we didn’t just meet like that, we met the same day at break time, but I don’t really count that, as we really just bonded over me dropping her off.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass"> With my amazing personality and all who wouldn’t enjoy spending time with me, like it’s just not possible. So as we were walking we talked, we laughed, but for the most part we bonded. For me that was the first time we really met, because the actual first time it was way too awkward and all I just can’t count that, we barely even talked that time, but when I went to drop her off, we got so many comments on us looking like siblings. We laughed about it for a while and we really bonded. I was planning on asking whether or not she has instagram because we had to depart mid conversation, but lucky for me she asked first so I was just enjoying life like that. I got back home late and find she has already added me, I follow her back and we begin talking.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass">As time goes on, our bond grows stronger. She becomes someone I truly trust, someone I respect, and someone that shows she trusts and respects me back, without me having to ask for it. That form of friendship is something I had been searching for for a very long time, but never really got it, as I always had to prove my self worth, prove I am trustworthy and had to ask for respect, but with her, I didn’t have to worry of any of that, it was just straight mutual trust and respect. As our bond grows I realise how similar we both are, I realise we aren’t just similar in the way we think, but also our past experiences. It was comforting knowing I have someone I can not only count on, but also understands me, without me having to explain myself.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass">After everything she is now my closest friend, and I still annoy her a lot, thats my character, I am annoying, but that’s only because I am comfortable around her. I sometimes end up acting childish around her, it is really just her who I am childish around because I am comfortable around her, I am still not used to being childish because I was never the childish person, I have always been the responsible and mature guy, but now I am comfortable around her, I act so childish I fear if someone saw me they’d assume I’m in Primary. I still annoy her, and she gets mad easily, but she can’t stay mad at me for too long, its a characteristic both of us share, we can’t stay mad at someone for too long, but this is different, her and I can’t stay mad at each other for longer than an hour. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass">Now obviously this kind of friendship can’t just form randomly. If it wasn’t for her character I doubt we would be friends. Khansa became someone I can count on. I realised that at around the end of term 1, when I didn’t do that well, and she was just there comforting me, insane right? A woman comforting a man, that’s the kind of friendship we had. Well during that time, I am not sure what she got, but she said she didn’t to that well either, but I am sure she did a lot better than me, but anyways, she just said, and I still remember to this day, she said, “Let’s do better next term, together.” That was the moment I realised I found someone that I can count on, someone that will always have my back when I need her. Thing about her is after everything she has gone through, all the times she has been betrayed by her friends, she always kept a kind heart, she always remained respectful, and grateful. After everything she has achieved she remained humble, that is very rare to come across. After all the times she’s been broken, and betrayed, she chose to trust me. I am truly grateful that of everyone she chose to trust me, and I am grateful such an amazing person walked into my life. I’ve <a href="secret.html">promised</a> to always be there for her, and I will. Speaking of <a href="secret.html">promises</a>, lets just not talk about how many of them I’ve made to her, but it’s fine, I know every <a href="secret.html">promise</a> I made, is one I can keep, and I will remain a man of my word.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pclass">I’ve talked about everything I could think of, but I feel like there is a lot more missing, unfortunately there aren’t enough words in the dictionary for express my gratitude to how she is, or enough words to express how nice of a person she is, or even enough words to express how our friendship is in the first place, but for that, I guess I will have to show it through actions rather than just words. Now all I can hope is I can repay the favor to her, and bring back the version of her that is carefree. I am sure, without a doubt in my mind, without having to think again, that she is worth it, she is worth every thing, she is worth all the effort and she always will be. Because if she isn't then no one on this world is. If such an amazing person isn't worth the effort, then no one is worth it, I just hope I will be able to be the friend she deserves, someone who can support her just as much as she has supported me, someone who can remind her of her own worth even when she forgets it, and someone who will always be there, no matter what.
