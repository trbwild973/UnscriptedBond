        <h3 class="h3class">To the bond that is unscripted and can’t be explained by a thousand or millions words. A story about two souls that met in a time they would never thought they would meet each other. Bonded together like two pieces of puzzle, weirdly shaped but a perfect fit. You might wonder who are the two souls? Well, it is the two KS, which is just Kavya Sharma and Khansa Salvia, an Indian boy and an Indonesian girl who met in an unexpected time. From the first time they meet, with the one interaction they had, and that one question that people always asked to them, they instantly clicked with each other like a perfect match of a lock and key. It’s hard to find a perfect key from many keys to open that one lock, but when the lock finally has a perfect match, it will finally open. That’s how their friendship is, when they finally met each other, they are a perfect friend duo that can complement each other. They both trust each other, which is the key of their friendship. For them when they trust each other, they can back up each other and be comfortable with opening up about their problems. This is a story of their friendship, bond, their journey together as the bestest friends, silly and funny stories, and many challenges ahead of them.
