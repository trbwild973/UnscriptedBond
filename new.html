    <p>
      Well darling, while you are complaining that I didn't get you anything this month, I was here planning this the whole time. There may be one anniversary I don't get you something, but baby on out half year? Really? Anyways, if you couldn't tell already, this is themed based on you, a taylor song, so now before reading more, hopefully we are on a call rn, bc I was keeping it for that moment, guess what song theme this is on. Anyways back to the 6 months part.
      Well, how does it feel, 6 months done, thats half a year now. Honestly to me it feels insane, like wow, almost a year now, but well either way I wouldn't miss making you something on our half year.
      Either way my baby, ik we have a lot of work today, but yea, be happy I have so much work to do and I was busy making this for you instead because I love you. I can't imagine a world without you child, 
      I love you so much and you have no idea how much you mean to me. I will always love you, and you will always mean more than the world to me. Thank you for everything, thank you for being there with me when I was down, 
      thank you for supporting me when I was giving up, just thank you for everything. I don't know how I'd ever repay you in this endless debt you've put me in, but no matter what happens, I will never stop showing you my love for you.
      I am sorry for sometimes when I didn't think some things through, and I am sorry for any other future time I make you mad or upset, I never have the intention to hurt you, I want nothing but for you to be happy child, I'm sorry.
      I will love you more than you know, and I will always love you for you. Don't give me a fake version others get, give it to them, I actually care about you, and I have no plans on changing that. I will always love you darling.
    </p>
