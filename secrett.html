        <h3 class="h3class">Well Khansa, all I can say is, thank you, thank you for everything, you were easily the best friend I could ever ask for, so thank you, for everything honestly, I don't know anymore, I have no words to say, you are an amazing person, I was lucky enough to have you as a friend. Thank you for everything, I've said it many times here, but I don't know, it doesn't feel enough, after everything I just don't know what to add on to it, but honestly thanks a lot. You brought me back child, this was easily the best year I've ever had, thanks to you, I am sorry, I wasn't able to bring you back, I tried, but I just couldn't the way you did. But I promise you child, lets meet up again, I will bring that happy you back. Well child, I don't know what else to add, you were an amazing friend, I had an amazing time with you, I was meant to make this as a letter and sneak it into your phone case yesterday (14th) but like I kinda forgot and like yea, so making it the website. But honestly, I don't know how to thank you enough for it, for everything, I will miss you a lot child, I will miss you more than you can possibly imagine, and I was always hurt about the fact that you are leaving soon, I am leaving before you, I just tried to not be sad over it, because I know if I show you I'm sad you'll get upset and all, but child I care for you a lot, I will miss you so much. I wish you all the best for when you are going to Indonesia, I wish you the best for your entry tests and all, give your best child, don't push yourself too much, I know you will be upset if things don't go your way, but I know no matter what happens, you'll have tried your best, wtv happens child, know I will always be proud of you. Aside from that, never forget, I will always be here for you, even if we stop talking for weeks, just send me a msg, we'll get back in touch, it will be difficult to do so and all with a 5hr time difference, but I know we can do it, I know you and I, we don't need to worry about it, I trust you the most child, I know you won't leave me, I know I don't need to worry about it. I trust you a lot child, I will never forget you, not in a million years will I be able to forget all the memories we've made in just a year. Actually less than that, a lot less than that. So thanks, for showing me that someone does care, thanks for showing me that I'm loved, thanks for everything my little child, I will miss you a lot, I just wish you the best, if anything comes up do let me know, now don't get tears in your eyes reading thing, I asked Eliana to be there for you today (15th) bc yea, so just talk to her if you feel like you can't hold it in anymore ok child. BTW, while u reading this, I wrote all this yesterday (14th) but using the terminology and time of today (15th) bc I'm telling u abt this today so yea.
