        <h2 class="h2class">Congrats, secret page #2, don't cry while reading this beautiful</h2>
        <h3 class="h3class">
Well Khansa, all I can say is, thank you, thank you for everything, you were easily the best friend I could ever ask for, so thank you, for everything honestly, I don't know anymore, I have no words to say, you are an amazing person, I was lucky enough to have you as a friend. Thank you for everything, I've said it many times here, but I don't know, it doesn't feel enough, after everything I just don't know what to add on to it, but honestly thanks a lot. You brought me back child, this was easily the best year I've ever had, thanks to you, I am sorry, I wasn't able to bring you back, I tried, but I just couldn't the way you did. But I promise you child, lets meet up again, I will bring that happy you back. Well child, I don't know what else to add, you were an amazing friend, I had an amazing time with you, I was meant to make this as a letter and sneak it into your phone case yesterday (14th) but like I kinda forgot and like yea, so making it the website. But honestly, I don't know how to thank you enough for it, for everything, I will miss you a lot child, I will miss you more than you can possibly imagine, and I was always hurt about the fact that you are leaving soon, I am leaving before you, I just tried to not be sad over it, because I know if I show you I'm sad you'll get upset and all, but child I care for you a lot, I will miss you so much. I wish you all the best for when you are going to Indonesia, I wish you the best for your entry tests and all, give your best child, don't push yourself too much, I know you will be upset if things don't go your way, but I know no matter what happens, you'll have tried your best, wtv happens child, know I will always be proud of you. Aside from that, never forget, I will always be here for you, even if we stop talking for weeks, just send me a msg, we'll get back in touch, it will be difficult to do so and all with a 5hr time difference, but I know we can do it, I know you and I, we don't need to worry about it, I trust you the most child, I know you won't leave me, I know I don't need to worry about it. I trust you a lot child, I will never forget you, not in a million years will I be able to forget all the memories we've made in just a year. Actually less than that, a lot less than that. So thanks, for showing me that someone does care, thanks for showing me that I'm loved, thanks for everything my little child, I will miss you a lot, I just wish you the best, if anything comes up do let me know, now don't get tears in your eyes reading thing, I asked Eliana to be there for you today (15th) bc yea, so just talk to her if you feel like you can't hold it in anymore ok child.            </h3>
<h3 class="h3class">
    Anyways, kinda lost track of where I last was, uhm, I just felt like adding smth more, idk still doesn't feel enough, after all those memories, after all those months, after everything, I'm leaving, you're leaving, its just wow, like it hurts honestly, I will miss you so much child, you don't understand how much I will miss you, you are always my mind, I literally couldn't sleep last night, yea I didn't tell u on chats bc yea, idk I just couldn't sleep, knowing today I am leaving, you are staying here, I don't know how to go on about my day without you, my day entirely revolves around our chats, around you getting mad at me, around everything. I will miss you, I will miss annoying you, I will miss tickling you ofc, I will miss those hugs, I will miss how you always complain to me, I will miss how you yap, I will miss everything about you, big or small, you are an amazing person Khansa, don't change yourself for someone else if they can't see the person you truly are. Stay the same, you are an amazing person, you don't need to change yourself for anyone. Well as much as it hurts me to say it, this day was going to come one day or another, it hurts, I know it was going to come, I saw it coming, but I wasn't ready, I'm still not ready for this. After today nothing will be the same between us, but all I can say is that we don't need to worry about growing apart, if you read the quote I put, a bond between two souls, most people are just friends, our souls synced before we even met, our souls connected from day 1, nothing can change what we have child, no one can change what we have, honestly seems like god was jealous so he had to put a small dent between us, he had to nerf us with distance fr, but its alg, get over these years, and then we'll meet again, and that day, the only thing I can say, is thats when the 2KS meet again. I will miss you child, but I don't want to see you crying over me, just stay strong child, I know you are, but don't hold in the tears if they are coming, it just makes everything worse. Well, see you soon child, not soon as in tomorrow, but soon for the next few years, let them fly by, if god put this barrier between us, he'll take it away faster. Take care child, for me, take care, make the right decisions with friends. I will never forget you child, I don't even need to think about it, we will stay in touch, yeah so niether will you have a change to forget me, we staying in touch, so no forgetting this now.
